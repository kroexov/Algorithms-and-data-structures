# Algorithms-and-data-structures-2021

This repository includes 13 laboratory works on algorithms and data structures which were made by me during the 1st year of ITMO. Here you will find examples of the dynamic programming, working with graphs and strings, etc.

Most of the work was done in C++ for obvious reasons (it solves problems with limited memory and time most productively), but there are also examples of Python code when it was possible to solve the problem in it.
